						<h2>The Pancakes</h2>
						Before the opening of our Freehold, Brick, Edgewater and Englewood Cliffs locations, the original Brownstone Pancake Factory was located in Jersey City.  Our family’s legacy began there over a half century ago! It is where the recipe behind our buttermilks was created. The recipe remains unwritten and exclusive to our family and a few trusted employees,
but the taste continues to be shared with our Brownstone family — you!
