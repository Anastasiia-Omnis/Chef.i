			<h2>COME TO CELEBRATE YOUR SPECIAL DAY, COME EVERYDAY!</h2>
	        <p style="text-align: center;">With every patron that comes through our doors, our mission is simple - make food fun! &nbsp;When our customers dine with us, we want it to be a destination with an experience, not just another meal. We strive to come up with unique (and sometimes borderline insane) creations with our pancakes and crazy shakes! We yearn to see our guests gasp, take pictures and get wide-eyed whenever one of our creations is about to approach a table. And the cherry on top is that our staff will make you feel loved and leave satisfied with a full belly! &nbsp;We hope you&rsquo;ll stop in and share a meal with us. Please be sure to bring your appetites&hellip;and your cameras! And yes&hellip;breakfast is served all day! &nbsp;We truly can&rsquo;t wait to host you!</p>
